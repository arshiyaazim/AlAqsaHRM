Please update my app with the following features and improvements:

1. **Make 'Employee ID' Field Autocomplete:**
   - Add a dropdown with 10 suggestions when typing in the 'Employee ID' field.
   - Make this field typeable/writeable on all pages.
   - However, on specific pages (Payroll Generation, Attendance, Ship Duty, Cash Receive/Payment, Loan & Advance), 
	disallow saving new Employee IDs if they don't already exist. For wrong entry show error message when click on save/update/add.

2. **Google Maps API Integration:**
   - I will provide a valid Google Maps API key. Ensure it's properly integrated across all relevant files.
   - Refactor the code if necessary to use this API key securely and effectively.
	API key is: 'AIzaSyCBs_ooC2c3rqybHsnYA34ADSmuZ4VLm1o'

3. **Authentication:**
   - Rebuild the Login/Signup system.
   - Ensure role-based login works: admin, HR, and viewer.
   - Create 3 default users with IDs, emails, and passwords (minimum 6 characters).
	and write these in .env file. after app deployment I will change all.
   - On successful login, redirect smoothly to the Dashboard without breaking any app feature.

4. **Environment and Config:**
   - Recheck and fix `.env`, `.env.example`, and `.config` files for correctness and best practices.
   - Ensure secure and readable variable use in code.

5. **Deployment Instructions:**
   - Include `README.txt` with:
     - App features and usage
     - Steps to build `.exe` file (if needed)
     - Deployment guide for Hostinger VPS/web hosting
     - Confirm and fix any `yaml` files used (e.g., for GitHub Actions or CI/CD)

6. **Mobile Responsiveness:**
   - Ensure the entire application is mobile-friendly and responsive using proper layout and styling (preferably TailwindCSS or Bootstrap).

Please apply all these changes and ensure the app works as intended.
