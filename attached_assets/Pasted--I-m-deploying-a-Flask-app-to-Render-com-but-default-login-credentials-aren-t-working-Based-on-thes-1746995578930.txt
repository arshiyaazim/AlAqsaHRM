"I'm deploying a Flask app to Render.com but default login credentials aren't working. Based on these requirements:

Need to ensure database tables AND default admin user are created automatically on first deployment

Must work with Render.com's environment

Need proper production configuration

Please review and modify these files as needed:

1. app.py - Should:

Initialize database tables if they don't exist

Create default admin user if none exists (username: 'admin', password: 'admin123' hashed)

Include CLI command for user creation

Remove debug mode in production

2. .env - Should contain:

Proper production database URL

Secret key

Any auth-related variables

3. .env.example - Should:

List all required environment variables

Include dummy values where needed

Match Render.com's requirements

4. render.yaml (if exists) - Should:

Properly configure build commands

Include environment variable setup

Specify database creation if needed

5. requirements.txt - Should:

Include all production dependencies

Specify proper WSGI server (gunicorn)

Please:

Show necessary modifications to each file

Explain how to test locally before deploying

Provide the exact build commands Render.com needs

Include security considerations for production

Suggest how to remove default credentials after initial setup

The solution should:

Work with Flask-SQLAlchemy

Use proper password hashing

Maintain both local dev and production compatibility

Follow Render.com best practices"

Additional notes to include if needed:

For database setup:
"Please ensure the solution works with either:

Render's PostgreSQL add-on, OR

SQLite for testing (but with proper production configuration for Render)"

For file structure:
"My current project structure has:

app.py (main application file)

/templates (for frontend)

/static (for assets)

.env and requirements.txt in root"

For deployment:
"Please provide both:

The immediate fix to get login working

The ideal long-term solution for user management"
