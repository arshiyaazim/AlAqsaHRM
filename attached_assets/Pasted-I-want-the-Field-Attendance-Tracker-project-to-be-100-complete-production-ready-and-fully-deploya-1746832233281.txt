I want the Field Attendance Tracker project to be 100% complete, production-ready, and fully deployable â€” with no remaining issues, errors, or missing features. Do not ask any questions or delay. Just execute everything below fully:

âœ… A. Offline Functionality (Final Completion)
Complete offline record synchronization via IndexedDB using existing logic in offline.js.

Implement missing Flask API endpoint(s) in app.py to receive and store offline records (attendance, photos, etc.).

Ensure background sync works once the connection is restored.

Use status indicators to confirm to the user when data is pending, synced, or failed.

âœ… B. Auto-Fix the directImportEmployeesFromExcel Error
Automatically create src/lib/fileUtils.ts if it doesnâ€™t exist.

In that file, define this function and export it:

ts
Copy
Edit
import * as XLSX from 'xlsx';

export interface Employee {
  name: string;
  email?: string;
  department?: string;
  position?: string;
  [key: string]: any;
}

export function directImportEmployeesFromExcel(buffer: Buffer): Employee[] {
  const workbook = XLSX.read(buffer, { type: 'buffer' });
  const sheetName = workbook.SheetNames[0];
  const sheet = workbook.Sheets[sheetName];
  const data = XLSX.utils.sheet_to_json<Employee>(sheet, { defval: '' });
  return data;
}
Update all imports across the project to:

ts
Copy
Edit
import { directImportEmployeesFromExcel } from './src/lib/fileUtils';
Fix any resulting TypeScript or path issues.

Restart the app automatically to verify resolution.

âœ… C. Finalize Field Connections
Finish implementing field-level connections where admin can:

Link one fieldâ€™s value to another field (e.g., department â†’ location)

Apply math operations (add, subtract, cumulative totals)

Display related values dynamically in the UI

Support these interactions both online and offline

âœ… D. Make the App Fully Responsive and Deployable
Finalize mobile optimization (especially clock-in/out, GPS, and camera integration).

Ensure all core workflows (attendance, admin functions, sync, login) work in mobile view.

Optimize PWA install prompt, offline cache, and mobile viewport behavior.

Add fallback messaging if device lacks GPS or camera access.

Finalize styling (buttons, fonts, colors) for clean mobile UI.

Clean up any unnecessary routes, files, or console errors.

âœ… E. Prepare for Deployment
Ensure the app is ready to deploy with:

Working build/start scripts

Fully working PWA capabilities

No import or runtime errors

Error logging integrated (use error_logs table)

Complete admin dashboard with all features requested earlier

ðŸ“¦ Final Note:
Just complete everything. Donâ€™t ask if somethingâ€™s unclear â€” pick the best option and implement it. Make sure nothing is left unfinished, and make no mistakes.
